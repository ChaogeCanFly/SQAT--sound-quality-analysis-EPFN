# Roughness model from Daniel & Weber: verification of the implementation in SQAT
In SQAT, an implementation of the roughness model from Daniel & Weber [1] is provided. The implementation is named `Roughness_Daniel1997` (see code [here](../../psychoacoustic_metrics/Roughness_Daniel1997/Roughness_Daniel1997.m)). In this folder, a thorough verification of the model implementation in SQAT is provided. The verification concerns the roughness dependence of amplitude-modulated (AM) and frequency-modulated (FM) sounds on different parameters, such as:

- [Roughness dependence of AM sounds on the modulation frequency](1_AM_modulation_freq)
- [Roughness dependence of AM sounds on the modulation depth](2_AM_modulation_depth)
- [Roughness dependence of FM sounds on the modulation depth](3_FM_modulation_depth)
- [Roughness dependence of FM sounds on the level](4_FM_level)
- [Roughness of unmodulated and AM white noise](5_white_noise)
