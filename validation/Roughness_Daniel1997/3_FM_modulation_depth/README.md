# About this code 
The `run_validation_roughness_FM_fmod.m` code is used to verify the `Roughness_Daniel1997` implementation (see code [here](../../../../psychoacoustic_metrics/Roughness_Daniel1997/Roughness_Daniel1997.m)) of the roughness model from Daniel & Weber [1]. The verification is performed considering frequency-modulated (FM) tones with carrier frequency $f_{\mathrm{c}}=1600~\mathrm{Hz}$, frequency deviation $f_{\mathrm{dev}}=800~\mathrm{Hz}$ and sound pressure level $L_{\mathrm{p}}=60~\mathrm{dB}~ \mathrm{SPL}$ as a function of the modulation frequency $f_{\mathrm{mod}}$. The reference is the roughness $R_o$ of a FM tone with the same parameters but a modulation frequency $f_{\mathrm{mod}}=70~\mathrm{Hz}$.  

# How to use this code
In order to run this code and reproduce the figures available in the `figs` folder, the user needs to download the dataset of sound files from zenodo <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7933206" target="_blank">here</a>. The obtained folder called `validation_SQAT_v1_0` has to be included in the `sound_files` folder of the toolbox. 

# Results
The figure below compares the results obtained using the `Roughness_Daniel1997` implementation in SQAT  with reference data obtained from listening tests [1]. The error bars express the roughness JND [2]. Results computed using SQAT correspond to the time-averaged roughness $R$.
