# Tonality model from Aures: verification of the implementation in SQAT
The `validation_signal_to_noise_ratio.m` code is used to verify the implementation of the tonality model from Aures [1] (see `Tonality_Aures1985` code [here](../../psychoacoustic_metrics/Tonality_Aures1985/Tonality_Aures1985.m)). The verification is performed considering pure tones (center frequency $f_{\mathrm{c}}=1000~\mathrm{Hz}$ and sound pressure level $L_{\mathrm{p}}=85~\mathrm{dB}~\mathrm{SPL}$) with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from narrowband noises (one-critical-band wide).

# How to use this code
In order to run this code and reproduce the figures available in the `figs` folder, the user needs to download the dataset of sound files from zenodo <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7933206" target="_blank">here</a>. The obtained folder called `validation_SQAT_v1_0` has to be included in the `sound_files` folder of the toolbox. 

# Results
The figures below compare the results obtained using the `Tonality_Aures1985` implementation in SQAT with reference data from [2].
