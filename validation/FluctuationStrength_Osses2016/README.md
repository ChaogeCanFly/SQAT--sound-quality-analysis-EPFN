# Fluctuation strength model from Osses *et al.*: verification of the implementation in SQAT
In SQAT, an implementation of the fluctuation strength model from Osses *et al.* [1] is provided. The implementation is named `FluctuationStrength_Osses2016` (see code [here](../../psychoacoustic_metrics/FluctuationStrength_Osses2016/FluctuationStrength_Osses2016.m)). In this folder, a verification of the model implementation in SQAT is provided. The verification concerns the fluctuation strength dependence of amplitude-modulated (AM) and frequency-modulated (FM) sounds on different parameters, such as:

- [Fluctuation strength dependence of AM tones on the modulation frequency](1_AM_tones_fmod)
- [Fluctuation strength dependence of AM broadband noises on the modulation frequency](2_AM_BBN_fmod)
- [Fluctuation strength dependence of FM tones on the modulation frequency](3_FM_tones_fmod)
- [Fluctuation strength dependence of FM sounds on the frequncy deviation](4_FM_tones_freq_dev)
