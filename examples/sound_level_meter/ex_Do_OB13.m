% Script ex_Do_OB13
%
% It produces the impulse response of the one-third octave band module 
% included in the sound level meter of the SQAT toolbox.
% The calculation is done for a unit impulse (amplitude 1) of 1 second of 
% duration at a sampling frequency of 48000 Hz, because the filter bank is
% hard coded to work on this sampling frequency.
% If you want to use as an input any other sound, just obtain your insig
% and fs using audioread, loading any wavfilename available on your disk, i.e.,
% use [insig,fs] = audioread(wavfilename).
