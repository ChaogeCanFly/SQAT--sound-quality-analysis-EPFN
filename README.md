# SQAT: A sound quality analysis toolbox for MATLAB
This is the repository of SQAT, a **S**ound **Q**uality **A**nalysis **T**oolbox for MATLAB.

# Toolbox structure
The toolbox has the following directories:
- `psychoacoustic_metrics`: This is the main directory of the toolbox. It contains a number of algorithms implementing a specific psychoacoustic metric. 
- `examples`: An example script is provided for each metric.
- `validation`: This directory contains scripts used to validate each algorithm. In order to reproduce the validation codes, the dataset of test sounds needs to be downloaded from Zenodo ([link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7933206)) and the paste `validation_SQAT_v1_0` has to be included in the `sound_files` folder of the toolbox.
- `sound_files`: This directory hosts reference sounds in .wav format that are used mainly by the `examples` codes. 
- `sound_level_meter`: Contains scripts to obtain sound pressure levels in dB(A), dB(C), or dB(Z), using fast or slow time weightings.
- `utilities`: Contains some scripts that are complementary to any of the toolbox functions.

# How to use the toolbox
After downloading this repository, you just need to add the toolbox into the path of your MATLAB. The `startup_SQAT` code provided can be used to automatically include all folders to the MATLAB path. However, in order to avoid conflicts, the `startup_SQAT` needs to be used everytime MATLAB is restarted. If you just want to use the metrics and no `sound_files`, you can add manually only the relevant folders to the path (e.g., `psychoacoustic_metrics`, `sound_level_meter` and `utilities`).
