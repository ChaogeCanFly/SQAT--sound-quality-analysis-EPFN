# SQAT: A sound quality analysis toolbox for MATLAB
This is the repository of SQAT, an open-source **S**ound **Q**uality **A**nalysis **T**oolbox for MATLAB.

# Toolbox structure
The toolbox has the following directories:
- `psychoacoustic_metrics`: this directory contains a number of algorithms implementing a specific psychoacoustic metric. 
- `sound_level_meter`: contains scripts to obtain sound pressure levels in dB(A), dB(C), or dB(Z), using fast or slow time weightings.
- `utilities`: contains some scripts that are complementary to any of the toolbox functions.
- `examples`: an example script is provided for each metric.
- `sound_files`: this directory hosts reference sounds in .wav format that are used mainly by the `examples` codes. 
- `validation`: this directory contains scripts used to validate each algorithm. In order to reproduce the validation codes, the dataset of test sounds needs to be downloaded from Zenodo ([link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7933206)) and the paste `validation_SQAT_v1_0` has to be included in the `sound_files` folder of the toolbox. 

# How to use the toolbox
After downloading this repository, you just need to add the toolbox into the path of your MATLAB. The `startup_SQAT` code provided can be used to automatically include all folders to the MATLAB path. However, in order to avoid conflicts, the `startup_SQAT` needs to be used everytime MATLAB is restarted. If you just want to use the metrics and no `sound_files`, you can add manually only the relevant folders to the path (e.g., `psychoacoustic_metrics`, `sound_level_meter` and `utilities`). 

# Sound quality metrics available in SQAT v1.0
The folowing psychoacoustic-based metrics are available in the `psychoacoustic_metrics` folder :
- `Loudness_ISO532_1`: Zwicker loudness model according to ISO 532-1:2016 (see validation [here](validation/Loudness_ISO532_1)).
- `Sharpness_DIN45692`: Sharpness according to DIN 45692:2009 (see validation [here](validation/Sharpness_DIN45692)). 
- `Roughness_Daniel1997`: Roughness model from Daniel & Weber (see validation [here](validation/Roughness_Daniel1997)). 
- `FluctuationStrength_Osses2016`: Fluctuation strength model from Osses et al. (see validation [here](validation/FluctuationStrength_Osses2016)). 
- `Tonality_Aures1985`: Tonality model from Aures (see validation [here](validation/Tonality_Aures1985)). 
- `PsychoacousticAnnoyance_Zwicker1999`: psychoacoustic annoyance model from Zwicker et al. 
- `PsychoacousticAnnoyance_More2010`: psychoacoustic annoyance model from More.
- `PsychoacousticAnnoyance_Di2016`: psychoacoustic annoyance model from Di et al.  

The folowing SPL-based metrics are available in the `sound_level_meter` folder:
