# About this script

The `pub_Osses2023c_Forum_Acusticum_SQAT.m` script generates the figures of the following publication:

Osses, A., Felix Greco, G., & Merino-Mart√≠nez, R. (2023). Considerations for the perceptual evaluation of steady-state and time-varying sounds using psychoacoustic metrics. **(to be presented at Forum Acusticum in September 2023)**

# How to use this code
To run the `pub_Osses2023c_Forum_Acusticum_SQAT.m` script, in addition to have initialised the SQAT toolbox, you need to download the three datasets of sounds used in the publication (Dataset 1, 2, and 3) from Zenodo <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7933489" target="_blank">here</a>. Although we recommend to place the downloaded files (after uncompressing them) into a folder called `Publications/pub_Osses2023c_Forum_Acusticum_SQAT/` into the folder `sound_files`, the files can actually be placed anywhere in your computer, as long as the sound files are visible to MATLAB (i.e., the folders are added to the MATLAB path). 

When running the script (either by running `pub_Osses2023c_Forum_Acusticum_SQAT.m` from the MATLAB command line or by pressing F5 from the script), you will get on screen the following options:
Enter 1 to do_table2
Enter 2 to do_table3
Enter 3 to do_fig1a
Enter 4 to do_fig1b
Enter 5 to do_fig1c
Enter 6 to do_fig2
Enter 7 to do_fig3
Enter 8 to do_fig3b
Enter 9 to do_fig_raw
Which table/figure you want to obtain (enter the corresponding number)?: 

So, for example, to obtain Fig. 1A you will need to enter number 3 and press enter.
