Copy here the selected sounds from Roberto's Google drive, such that the files are organised in the following folders:
	../sound_files/publications/pub_Osses2023a_Forum_Acusticum_SQAT/1-Aircraft-fly-by/
	../sound_files/publications/pub_Osses2023a_Forum_Acusticum_SQAT/2-Train-pass-by/
	../sound_files/publications/pub_Osses2023a_Forum_Acusticum_SQAT/3-Hummer-resonances/

Datasets 1, 2, and 3 were provided by Roberto, Gil, and Alejandro, respectively.

The original sounds were moved to my (Alejandro's) external hard disk (Folder: SQM_paper_2023_extra_raw_no-commit)
